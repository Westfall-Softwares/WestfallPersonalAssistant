- Real-time status indicators
- Model connection status
- GPU information display
- Settings persistence
- Error handling and user feedback

## Dependencies

### Frontend (package.json)
- electron: Desktop application framework
- react: UI framework
- @mui/material: Component library
- electron-store: Settings persistence

### Backend (requirements.txt)
- fastapi: REST API framework
- uvicorn: ASGI server
- pydantic: Data validation

### Optional (Phase 2+)
- opencv-python: Computer vision
- pytesseract: OCR text extraction
- pillow: Image processing
- torch: PyTorch for GPU acceleration
- transformers: Hugging Face models
- llama-cpp-python: GGUF/GGML support

## Development Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run in development:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev  # Starts both frontend and backend
   ```

3. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build-react
   npm run build
   ```

## Architecture Notes

### Security
- All processing done locally
- No external data transmission
- Secure IPC communication
- Optional sensitive data masking

### Performance
- GPU acceleration when available
- Memory-efficient model loading
- Optimized for RTX 2060 (6GB VRAM)
- Automatic resource management

### Privacy

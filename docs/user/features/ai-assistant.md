## Tips for Effective AI Interaction

### Writing Good Prompts

#### Be Specific
❌ **Vague**: "Help with email"
✅ **Specific**: "Help me write a professional follow-up email to a client who hasn't responded to my proposal from last week"

#### Provide Context
❌ **No context**: "Create a budget"
✅ **With context**: "Create a monthly budget for a family of four with $5,000 income, focusing on saving for a house down payment"

#### Use Examples
❌ **Abstract**: "Make this sound better"
✅ **With example**: "Make this email sound more professional, similar to how a consultant would write to a CEO"

### Getting Better Results

#### Break Down Complex Requests
Instead of: "Plan my entire week"
Try:
1. "What are my priorities this week?"
2. "When are the best times for focused work?"
3. "How should I organize my meetings?"

#### Iterate and Refine
- Start with a basic request
- Ask follow-up questions
- Refine based on AI suggestions
- Build on previous responses

#### Use the Right Mode
- **Quick questions** → Normal mode
- **Complex analysis** → Thinking mode  
- **Learning/research** → Research mode

# Frequently Asked Questions

Find answers to the most common questions about Westfall Personal Assistant.

## General Questions

### What is Westfall Personal Assistant?

Westfall Personal Assistant is a comprehensive, AI-powered desktop application that combines multiple productivity tools while keeping your data secure and private on your local machine. It includes features like email management, password storage, note-taking, finance tracking, and an intelligent AI assistant.

### Is my data secure?

Yes, security is our top priority:
- All sensitive data is encrypted using military-grade AES-256 encryption
- Your master password is never stored - it's used to derive encryption keys
- Data stays on your local machine unless you explicitly use cloud features
- No personal data is sent to external services without your permission

### What platforms are supported?

Westfall Personal Assistant runs on:
- **Windows** 10 and 11 (64-bit)
- **macOS** 10.14 (Mojave) and later
- **Linux** distributions with Python 3.8+ support

### How much does it cost?

Westfall Personal Assistant is completely free and open-source, licensed under the MIT License. You can use it for personal or commercial purposes without any restrictions.

## Installation and Setup

### What are the system requirements?

**Minimum Requirements:**
- Python 3.8 or higher
- 4GB RAM
- 2GB available disk space
- Internet connection (for initial setup and online features)

**Recommended:**
- Python 3.10 or higher
- 8GB RAM
- 5GB available disk space
- Stable internet connection

### Why won't the application start?

Common causes and solutions:

1. **Python not installed or wrong version**
   - Install Python 3.8+ from python.org
   - Verify with `python --version`

2. **Missing dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Permission issues**
   - Run as administrator (Windows) or with sudo (Linux/macOS)
   - Check file permissions on installation directory

4. **Antivirus blocking**
   - Add application to antivirus exceptions
   - Temporarily disable real-time protection during installation

### Can I install without internet?

The initial installation requires internet to download dependencies. However, once installed, most features work offline. Only weather, news, and external AI features require internet connectivity.

## Security and Privacy

### What happens if I forget my master password?

Unfortunately, there's no way to recover a forgotten master password - this is by design for security. If you forget it, you'll need to:

1. Reset the application (losing all encrypted data)
2. Set up the application again with a new master password
3. Restore data from any unencrypted backups you may have

**Prevention**: Always write down your master password in a secure location!

### Can I change my master password?

Yes, you can change your master password:

1. Go to Settings → Security → Change Master Password
2. Enter your current password
3. Enter and confirm your new password
4. The application will re-encrypt all data with the new password

### How often should I backup my data?

We recommend backing up your data:
- **Daily** for critical data (passwords, important notes)
- **Weekly** for general data
- **Before major updates** to the application
- **Before changing your master password**

### Where is my data stored?

Data is stored locally on your computer:

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\WestfallPersonalAssistant\`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/WestfallPersonalAssistant/`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/WestfallPersonalAssistant/`

## Features and Usage

### Can I import data from other applications?

5. If auto-detection fails, manually enter IMAP/SMTP settings
6. Test the connection and save

For major providers, settings are automatically configured.

### Why isn't my weather/news updating?

This usually indicates an API key issue:

1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify API keys in Settings → API Keys
3. Ensure API keys are valid and not expired
4. Check if you've exceeded API usage limits
5. Try refreshing manually from the feature settings

## Troubleshooting

### The application is running slowly

Common solutions:

1. **Restart the application** - Clears memory and cache
2. **Check system resources** - Close other memory-intensive programs
3. **Clear application cache** - Settings → Advanced → Clear Cache
4. **Optimize database** - Settings → Maintenance → Optimize Database
5. **Update to latest version** - Newer versions often include performance improvements

### I can't sync my calendar

Calendar sync issues are usually related to:

1. **Authentication** - Re-enter calendar service credentials
2. **Permissions** - Ensure calendar access is enabled
3. **Two-factor authentication** - Use app-specific passwords
4. **Firewall** - Allow application through firewall
5. **Service outages** - Check if the calendar service is experiencing issues

### The AI Assistant isn't responding

Check these potential issues:

1. **Internet connection** - Required for cloud AI features
2. **API keys** - Verify OpenAI API key is correctly configured
3. **API limits** - Check if you've exceeded usage limits
4. **Local models** - Try switching to local AI models
5. **Service status** - Check OpenAI service status
